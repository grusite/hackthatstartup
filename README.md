## Instructions

- MongoDB: First download Mongo in your local PC
- MongoDB: Then create a folder to store your DB inside your user directory (e.g `'/c/Users/userNAme/data/db'`)
- MongoDB: Then start a local server: `mongod --dbpath='/c/Users/userNAme/data/db'`
- To init the DB with some preset users execute `npm run installDB`
- To start the server in dev mode execute `npm run dev`
- To execute linter in all files `npm run linter`
- To start the server with the DB formated and the linter `npm run initDB-dev`

* models -> where I store the DB model
* controllers -> where I store the route controllers
* public -> all necesary to interact with front
* .env -> file with user information. The person who runs the code will need to refill the data
